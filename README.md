### About Me

I'm a casual learner committed to perpetual understanding of things.  

### Research Interests

- Quantum Computing 
- Large-scale Quantum Simulations
- Theoretical & Computational Particle Physics 
- Applied ML 

### Academic Goals

While my specific research focus is still taking shape, I'm embracing the breadth of academic possibilities during my undergrad years. I'm possibly drawn to graduate studies in theoretical aspects, but I remain open to exploring a wide spectrum of subjects in the interim.

### Current Work

- [Current work](#current-projects-repo-link) - Check my ongoing work on developing a QC algorithm to optimize different quantum systems simulations.

### Past Projects
